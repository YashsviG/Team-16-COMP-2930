of considering cost and time when selecting shipping options,we tendto raise
environmental awareness for online buyers  so that they can consider another choice
which is more environmentally friendly .Our mission is to provide an alternative solution when buying stuff online and creating
awareness amongst the citizens.Letâ€™s switch to ShipGreen, a step towards a greener future!
A little patience to receive products, can lead to companies sending fully loaded trucks,

           <h2>Our Story</h2>
           <p>Shipping Industry is an essential part of E-commerce these days and is the one  that needed a change . All the   team members were interested in the idea as it was very unique and untouched  So basically Arun was Surfing the  Internet and found a very useful video on youtube that demonstrated the environmental effects two day shipping has on the environment and needed to change . So while  pondering on these issues we all sat down and came up  with the idea of green shipping option that will provide an alternative option for shipping to the users. Another main reason behind the idea was the lack of awareness , users never even gave a thought before choosing the shipping options and were unaware of the ill-effects it has on the  Environment  So the next biggest challenge  was how to attract users was that  that why would anyone go for the green shipping option express shipping is available . We came up with the plan to provide the users the information   about how much are they contributing towards saving the environment , which will motivate more and more people to get into green shipping .   </p>
